# Slack real names + handles

A Chrome extension to display Slack handles alongside real names.
This is especially useful on large community Slacks where you don't
necessarily know everyone by handle.

[Install on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slack-real-names-%2B-handle/hlebmnlokgglggfmafocplopinfpkiad)

Simply install the extension from the Chrome Web Store, ensure that
"Display real names instead of usernames" is checked in the "Messages
& Media" section of your preferences, and reload.
